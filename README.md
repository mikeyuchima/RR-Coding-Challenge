## Getting Started

1. install all the npm packages

```
npm install
```

3. start the WebSocket server

```
node start.js
```

2. start the react server

```
npm start
```

4. open your browser

```
localhost:3000
```

### `node start.js`

Runs the WebSocket Server @(ws://localhost:8080/websocket).<br>
Must run this on terminal first before running the app.

### `npm start`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
